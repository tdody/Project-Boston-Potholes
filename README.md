# Springboard-Capstone-1

NOTE TO TIM:

Data-Wrangling-Weather.ipynb is done  
Data_Wrangling_Potholes.ipynb is done up to the geolocalization using Google API.  
Google_Geo_API_Fetcher.ipynb is barely started. I am thinking of using this notebook to work with the API outside of the main project frame.
