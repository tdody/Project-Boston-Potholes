It is an important city service for your neighborhood to provide the best permanent repairs of previous utility excavations or potholes.    The construction process is to dig out 6.5 inches of material and place 5 inches of dense binder hot mix asphalt in 2 lifts. The dense binder gives the patch its strength but is has large stones and is not conducive to providing a smooth ride  the contractor usually within a week comes back and places 1.5 inches of the top course. The top course is hot mix asphalt that provides the smooth ride.    What the constituent observed was the patch awaiting final top course.     The work is now complete.      The city apologizes for the inconvenience this necessary work has caused.

The city highly encourages this type of work. It will eliminate possible future emergency leak repairs.     The city acknowledges that the construction will cause an inconvenience to the residents.    However in the long run the construction is well worth it.     Having a street dug up for emergency repairs soon after paving is frustrating for all. With the new gas main installed  the city can feel extremely comfortable that no embarrassing street cuts will happen if it determines to pave Norfolk St in the future.     The CIU agrees that the trench was in unacceptable condition.      We held off as long as we could in having them do the trench over because there are over 40 services that need to be connected from the trench to each house.    We wanted to wait to after that work was done to mill and pave the trench  and the laterals.     However the condition would not allow that  and that's why we milled and paved the trench now.    The City will come back next year and perform a permanent trench repair.

Closed date : 2016-06-29 08:18:48.397 Case Resolved Dear Constituent     Before excavating in Massachusetts  its the law to call dig safe so that out all the underground utilities are marked out with paint.    This allows the contractor to dig safely and not to hit an underground utility line such as the gas main.     Its is rightfully so a mandatory requirement .    The City does shares your frustration that after the work is complete the paint could be being viewed as graffiti by the public.     We have reached out to the utility companies asking if they could develop a paint that wore off more quickly.    Obviously the paint needs to stay visible while the work takes place.    Because there is so much excavation going on in the City  if we require a utility to power wash off a digsafe marking  we may be washing off new dig safe markings for another ticket called in for a  new excavation.     This could cause a contractor to inadvertently hit an underground pipe causing a possible Public Safety situation  and creating a liability issue for the City.     Its a dilemma that we are working on  its not an easy remedy ... However it's important to remember that Public Safety trumps all      Eventually the paint should wear off over time.

They leave the trench down low in binder because they come back  after installing the main and do service connections to each house which would result in a very poor paving job.      Once the services are done  they top the whole trench at once  and don't leave any service cut seams.     I know the binder being down low  in front of the yard for snow operations was not optimal.      If it was in the middle of Winter I would make them top the trench.      If you feel a section needs to be plated because it affects equipment going in and out of the yard  give me a call and I will make that happen.     I will make sure the crew sweeps and cleans up after each day.

These gas mains could be almost 100 years old  and obviously need replacement.     The city highly encourages this type of work. It will eliminate possible future emergency leak repairs.     The city acknowledges that the construction will cause an inconvenience to the residents.    However in the long run the construction is well worth it.     Having a street dug up for emergency repairs soon after paving is frustrating for all. With the new gas main installed  the city can feel extremely comfortable that no embarrassing street cuts will happen if it determines to pave your street in the future.     The work is almost complete  they need to tie in the services to the homes along the new replacement limits.     Any trench that is not smooth and level at the end of the job we will require the contractor to mill and pave the trench over.     The inspector will monitor the worksite to ensure full compliance with the city's rules.     The city apologizes for the inconvenience this necessary work has caused.

The city encourages this type of capital upgrade work.  It will eliminate future emergency repairs.      National Grid has to install the gas main first.  Once the main has been installed  then all service connections can be made.      If the city were to make National Grid pave to grade each day's trench work   it would cause multiple seams along the trench.  More importantly  every service connection needs to be cut into the trench. Paving the trench every day would end up with  2 by 2 patches in front of every house inside the paved trench area  resulting in a very poor final product.      In order to have the best final paving  the city allows the utility company to leave the trench down low until all service connections are made and then pave the trench all at once  resulting in a smooth  level final trench repair.  Service laterals are topped within 24 hours of excavation.       What the constituent is observing is the trench left down low in preparation for one continuous final paving operation.    The trench is scheduled to be paved this week    Mark Cardarelli  Supervisor of Utility Coordination and Compliance  Boston Public Works Department  617-635-4951 Office,,Request for Pothole Repair,PWDx_Contractor Complaints,PWDx,INTERSECTION of Corinth St & Washington St  Roslindale  MA,12,6,5,E5,Roslindale,10,20,,INTERSECTION Corinth St & Washington St,,42.3594,-71.0587,Constituent Call,TRUE,TRUE,TRUE

The city encourages this type of capital upgrade work.  It will provide dependable gas service to the residents as well as  eliminate future emergency repairs.      The city acknowledges that the construction will cause an inconvenience to the residents.    However in the long run the placement of a new gas main is well worth it.      National Grid has to install the gas main first.  Once the main has been installed  then all service connections can be made.       If the city were to make National Grid pave to grade each day's trench work   it would cause multiple seams along the trench.    More importantly  every service connection needs to be cut into the trench.  If we were to pave the trench every day   this would result in 2 by 2 patches inside the trench area  resulting in a very poor final product.      In order to have the best final paving  the city allows the utility company to leave the trench down low until all service connections are made and then pave the trench all at once  resulting in a smooth  level final trench repair.     Service laterals are topped within 24 hours of excavation.       What the constituent is observing is the trench left down low in preparation for one continuous final paving operation.    We do require that the contractor place florescent orange signs ahead of the construction informing motorists that the trench ahead is down low     We have instructed Feeney to do over some of the test pits that were to grade.

The city encourages this type of capital upgrade work.  It will eliminate future emergency repairs.      National Grid has to install the gas main first.  Once the main has been installed  then all service connections can be made.      If the city were to makeNational Grid pave to grade each day's trench work   it would cause multiple seams along the trench.    More importantly  every service connection needs to be cut into the trench.  If we were to pave the trench every day   this would result in 2 by 2 patches inside the trench area  resulting in a very poor final product.      In order to have the best final paving  the city allows the utility company to leave the trench down low until all service connections are made and then pave the trench all at once  resulting in a smooth  level final trench repair.     Service laterals are topped within 24 hours of excavation.       What the constituent is observing is the trench left down low in preparation for one continuous final paving operation.

The phases of the work include :    Excavating the roadway/sidewalk  Installing or repairing the pipe or conduit  Backfilling the excavation and placing a binder asphalt course  The binder asphalt course is left down 1.5 inches awaiting the final top course for a few days  Then the patch has the final top course applied    By letting the traffic hit the binder course for a few days the City will end up having a more solid repair.

Obviously we don't want to pave knowing it will be dug up soon afterwards.    We did have our patch paving contractor repair previous utility cuts and potholes last year.      He is scheduled to come back to Dudley St this Spring.      We have also contacted the utility companies who manholes are not on grade.      Between the patching and the manholes being adjusted to street grade  Dudley will ride better then it does now.    For questions on the paving dates  you can call the number listed below.

Because of the light and the traffic  the intersection has a tremendous amount of shoving  which caused the roadway to become uneven.     In addition there was a utility trench last year that is not in optimal condition.     The good news is that intersection is going to be resurfaced in 2017. We have contacted the contractor and will make him repair the location you have pointed out.     In addition we will have any castings make loud noise be repaired.     We believe this will alleviate your situation     For any questions or concerns  please contact the number listed below     Sincerely      Mark Cardarelli   Supervisor of Utility Coordination and Compliance   Boston Public Works Department   617-635-4951 Office,,Request for Pothole Repair,PWDx_Contractor Complaints,PWDx,INTERSECTION of Prince St & Causeway St  Boston  MA,3,1B,1,A1,Downtown / Financial District,3,3,302,INTERSECTION Prince St & Causeway St,,42.3594,-71.0587,Citizens Connect App,TRUE,TRUE,TRUE

Closed date : 2016-05-07 08:31:20.933 Case Resolved Dear Constituent     Before excavating in Massachusetts  its the law to call dig safe so that out all the underground utilities are marked out with paint.    This allows the contractor to dig safely and not to hit an underground utility line such as the gas main.     Its is rightfully so a mandatory requirement .    The City does shares your frustration that after the work is complete the paint could be being viewed as graffiti by the public.     We have reached out to the utility companies asking if they could develop a paint that wore off more quickly.    Obviously the paint needs to stay visible while the work takes place.    Its a dilemma that we are working on  its not an easy remedy ... however its important to remember that Public Safety trumps all      Eventually the paint should wear off over time.    If the markings are still there in the next 60 -90 days please contact my office.

Closed date : 2016-06-03 09:25:30.29 Case Resolved Dear Constituent     The PWD Roadway Repair Contractor is working on your street performing patch paving.    It is an important city service for your neighborhood to provide the best permanent repairs of previous utility excavations or potholes.    The construction process is to dig out 6.5 inches of material and place 5 inches of dense binder hot mix asphalt in 2 lifts. The dense binder gives the patch its strength but is has large stones and is not conducive to providing a smooth ride  the contractor usually within a week comes back and places 1.5 inches of the top course. The top course is hot mix asphalt that provides the smooth ride.    What the constituent observed was the patch awaiting final top course.     For scheduling  question you can call the City Engineer Tom Mougamian at 617-304-7308.    The city apologizes for the inconvenience this necessary work has caused.
